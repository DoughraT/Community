# Troubleshooting
If the above installation process does not work, you will need to change the python path to match where you installed pyton on your own device.

1. Find the path where your python.exe is installed in your own system. <br>
2. Copy that path. <br>
3. Go into `community-main/virt/` and open `pyvenv.cfg` in any editor and past the path from step 1 into the file and save.
